## Phlat
simple and fast, dark theme made for Xfce.

Depends on: GTK(mist, murrine and pixbuf engine) and GTK3>=3.20, 

Note: The GTK3 theme recommends [GTK3-NOCSD](https://github.com/PCMan/gtk3-nocsd) and to disable the GTK3 overlay scrollbars (export GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0)!

### Optional
- If you want to change the blue highlight color to something else:

 * needs sed, tr and find! - you may should install [yad](http://sourceforge.net/projects/yad-dialog) or [qarma-qt5](https://github.com/luebking/qarma) for a better color selection.

```
sh .changecolor.sh
```
